These are a few quick tips for when you're experiencing problems with the Windows Store in Windows 8(.1)/9 and opening apps in Windows 8(.1)/9.

## Symptoms:
  * clicking on a link to a Windows Store app shows a page telling you that the app could not be found
  * clicking on a tile in the Windows Store doesn't do anything
  * the Windows Store doesn't open

  1. Make sure you're connected to the Internet.
  1. Press R while holding the Windows key on your keyboard.
