      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This blog is built with &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to use some great CI tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://wercker.com&#34;&gt;Wercker&lt;/a&gt;. The first part of writing a &lt;em&gt;wercker.yml&lt;/em&gt; is picking a build container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A build container on Wercker is the environment in which your build or deploy steps run. Wercker used to build its own containers for that, but they&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from that approach to Docker containers. You can use all kinds of Docker containers, but most people just use one available publicly on &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.hub.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy my website to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;, all I need is Git. So that&amp;rsquo;s why I built &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/samueldebruyn/debian-git/&#34;&gt;this simple Docker container&lt;/a&gt; with Debian and Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this blog requires some more packages. Wercker doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically pull in your Git submodules, so Git is also a necessity there. Another one is Hugo, to build the static website itself. Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t minimize your files, however. That&amp;rsquo;s why I also include &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor&#34;&gt;YUI compressor&lt;/a&gt; (minifies *.js and *.css) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier&#34;&gt;HTML minifier&lt;/a&gt; (like the name says, minifies HTML files). Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer&#34;&gt;HTML proofer&lt;/a&gt; to validate the generated HTML files and check them for dead links. All of these packages (and their dependencies) are available in my Docker container called &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/samueldebruyn/hugo-build/&#34;&gt;hugo-build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;side-notes:32cb3da98bb2342bbc176f65d9a11aa9&#34;&gt;Side notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugo-build:32cb3da98bb2342bbc176f65d9a11aa9&#34;&gt;hugo-build&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is quite big. It needs Java for YUI compressor, Ruby for html-proofer and Node for html-minifier. Setting up the environment and storing the container each take about half a minute. If you have some suggestions on making the image smaller, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/docker-hugo-build&#34;&gt;submit an issue or a pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest list of included packages is available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/docker-hugo-build&#34;&gt;README file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build often fails on a time-out while running &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s usually &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; by running another build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;html-proofer:32cb3da98bb2342bbc176f65d9a11aa9&#34;&gt;html-proofer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;html-proofer will often fail because it scans your website for dead links before your website is even published. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to work around this, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/pull/178&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s an issue&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s keeping track of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-wercker-yml-using-these-images:32cb3da98bb2342bbc176f65d9a11aa9&#34;&gt;Example &lt;em&gt;wercker.yml&lt;/em&gt; using these images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog uses these images to build and deploy automatically through Wercker. The source code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/sa.muel.be-hugo&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The right way to create Windows installation media</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/the-right-way-to-create-windows-installation-media/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to create a USB stick to install Windows. Chances are you end up with an error during the installation or you (unknowingly) use the wrong partition layout for your HDD/SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-an-iso:3801f6e2347d9f00533e49d882bdd246&#34;&gt;Get an ISO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which version of Windows do you want to install? This guide would work fine with Windows Vista or newer, but you can get an ISO for Windows 10 Home/Pro on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with that page, however, is that it redirects you to a download of a media creation tool if you&amp;rsquo;re opening the page on a Windows PC. The media creation tool allows you to download an ISO image, but it &lt;a href=&#34;http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1451630/windows-10-installation-errors.png&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work properly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fiddle with your user agent settings (the hard way)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or open it up on your smartphone/tablet, select the version of Windows you want to download and send the direct download link to yourself (the easy way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-rufus:3801f6e2347d9f00533e49d882bdd246&#34;&gt;Get Rufus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rufus.akeo.ie/&#34;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; is a simple tool which lets you easily create bootable USB sticks for any kind of operating system. All you have to do is download it. Rufus doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-the-image:3801f6e2347d9f00533e49d882bdd246&#34;&gt;Creating the image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now plug in your USB stick, fire up Rufus and point it to your USB stick (first dropdown list) and the ISO image (button next to the last dropdown list) you just downloaded. &lt;strong&gt;Pay attention&lt;/strong&gt; to the next steps, because Rufus will delete everything on the USB stick/disk you select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;em&gt;GPT with UEFI&lt;/em&gt; for the partition layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick &lt;em&gt;FAT32&lt;/em&gt; as filesystem (no, NTFS won&amp;rsquo;t work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave the cluster size at its default setting (&lt;em&gt;4096 bytes&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the checkmark next to &lt;em&gt;Create bootable disk with ISO image&lt;/em&gt; is checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all you have to do is press &lt;em&gt;Start&lt;/em&gt; and wait a few minutes (depends on the speed of your USB device, could take about 15 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;booting-the-image:3801f6e2347d9f00533e49d882bdd246&#34;&gt;Booting the image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide ends here, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to boot your PC from the installation image you just created, consult the manual of your PC, BIOS or motherboard. &lt;em&gt;Usually you need to press one of the F-buttons while the logo of your motherboard&amp;rsquo;s manufacturer is displayed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;re in your BIOS, make sure to enable &lt;em&gt;AHCI&lt;/em&gt; in the settings of your SATA ports and &lt;em&gt;UEFI&lt;/em&gt; in your boot settings. Always pick the listed &lt;em&gt;UEFI&lt;/em&gt; device when you select a boot device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-a-new-workhorse:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Ordering a new workhorse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 RTM &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/img/post/dinoclippy.jpg&#34; title=&#34;awesome wallpaper&#34;&gt;has been out&lt;/a&gt; for about a month now after little less than a year of public &lt;a href=&#34;https://insider.windows.com/&#34; title=&#34;Insider program&#34;&gt;Insider preview&lt;/a&gt; builds. The motherboard of my old, trusty, Asus laptop was slowly dying and the Dell XPS 13&amp;rsquo;s thinness and battery life looked very attractive. I decided to go for it and order a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-13-9343-laptop/&#34; title=&#34;Dell XPS 13&#34;&gt;Dell XPS 13 (2015)&lt;/a&gt;, without the touch screen. I hate dirty fingerprints on a screen and the better battery life of the version without the touch screen seemed like a better deal. I also ordered a &lt;a href=&#34;http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;s=dhs&amp;amp;cs=19&amp;amp;sku=470-abhh&#34; title=&#34;Dell adapter&#34;&gt;USB 3 -&amp;gt; HDMI/VGA/Ethernet/USB 2 adapter&lt;/a&gt; from Dell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Dell&amp;rsquo;s website tells you they will ship it in about 4 business days, it took nearly 3 weeks until UPS rang my bell with a shipment from China. By the way, Dell Belgium&amp;rsquo;s sales support is terrible. They offer support by phone and chat, but they will tell you on both channels that you have to send them an email. The Belgian support department was very abrupt and impolite. They can&amp;rsquo;t tell you why it looks like your laptop is sitting in an UPS storage facility in China without moving for about a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-steps:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did after unpacking everything, was booting it up and installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.runtime.org/driveimage-xml.htm&#34; title=&#34;DriveImage XML&#34;&gt;DriveImage XML&lt;/a&gt; to create a complete image of every partition so it would be easy to restore if something ever went &lt;a href=&#34;http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1451630/windows-10-installation-errors.png&#34; title=&#34;Something happened&#34;&gt;terribly wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Windows also comes with &lt;a href=&#34;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive&#34;&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to create system recovery images on USB sticks etc. This tool copies the recovery partition to a USB stick, together with Windows recovery tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side note: a lot of programs like DriveImage XML looked very blurry on the XPS 13&amp;rsquo;s 1080p screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-many-windows-10s:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;So many Windows 10s!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;a href=&#34;http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/windows-10-upgrade-paths&#34; title=&#34;Windows 10 upgrade path&#34;&gt;simply upgrade&lt;/a&gt; the Windows 8.1 installation that shipped with the XPS 13, I&amp;rsquo;d get the most basic version of Windows 10. This edition doesn&amp;rsquo;t suffice for most software developers. I signed in to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamspark.com/&#34; title=&#34;Microsoft Dreamspark&#34;&gt;Microsoft Dreamspark&lt;/a&gt; and got the free Windows 10 Education Edition I&amp;rsquo;m entitled to as an IT student. I had the choice of installing the Enterprise or the Education edition. The Education edition comes with &lt;a href=&#34;http://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Win10EditionsCompareTable_FINAL.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Feature comparison&#34;&gt;more features&lt;/a&gt; than the Home/Pro Edition and I figured the Enterprise edition wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as easy to install outside of a domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rebooted the machine with the Windows 10 installation media and deleted every partition on the SSD. After the installation, Windows 10 guides you through the final steps of setting up your new PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, they ask you to sign in to a Microsoft account and offer you to restore the apps and settings from another machine on which you&amp;rsquo;re signed in. Apparently that&amp;rsquo;s not the case if you picked the Education edition: sign in with a domain account or create a local user account. I could link my local account to a Microsoft account after the initial setup, but my desktop now shows a white watermark in the bottom right corner saying &lt;em&gt;Windows 10 Education&lt;/em&gt; (which is impossible to remove &lt;a href=&#34;http://superuser.com/questions/947231/how-can-i-remove-the-windows-10-education-watermark-from-my-dreamspark-license&#34; title=&#34;Get rid of the watermark&#34;&gt;without changing some HEX values&lt;/a&gt; in the registry&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-boot:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The first boot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blurriness was back. About every non-modern app looked blurry. Probably driver issues, right? Dell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/19/campaigns/windows-upgrade-offer&#34;&gt;support site&lt;/a&gt; says that the XPS 13 is ready for Windows 10. Okay&amp;hellip; But the driver section doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a graphics driver. I installed all the available Windows 10 drivers and some Windows 8 drivers which weren&amp;rsquo;t available in the Windows 10 section. I found drivers for the Intel HD 5500 and some other Intel components on Intel&amp;rsquo;s website and Realtek&amp;rsquo;s website has Windows 10 drivers for SD card reader and the audio chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation of the graphics driver failed miserably. In the final step of the installation my screen turned black, showing just a white mouse pointer. It stayed that way for more than 15 minutes. Although, after a reboot (had to press the power button for a few seconds), the driver seemed to be &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation of the audio driver just failed completely. The first step of the installation uninstalls your existing driver and asks you to reboot. The second step should install the new driver, but after a reboot the installation process started over. I stopped trying after 4 attempts as audio seemed to be working fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-blurriness-is-here-to-stay:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The blurriness (is here to stay)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still there. I fiddled a little bit with the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel and enabled some settings that should improve the quality of textures. That was a bad choice. If you enable most settings in the &lt;em&gt;3D&lt;/em&gt; section of the control panel, textures in modern apps will look very dark and the Windows 10 start menu becomes one dark grey mess. &lt;strong&gt;Disable all settings in the &lt;em&gt;3D&lt;/em&gt; section of the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel on Windows 10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next try was &lt;a href=&#34;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-text-easier-read-cleartype#1TC=windows-7&#34; title=&#34;ClearType settings&#34;&gt;ClearType&lt;/a&gt;. This helped a little bit with the blurriness, but not that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I played with the DPI scaling. The factory default is 150%. I found that 125% is not too blurry and not too small. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer a non-blurry screen on 150% scaling though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concluded that most Windows applications simply aren&amp;rsquo;t built with high DPI screens in mind. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://retinamacapps.com/&#34;&gt;the retina story&lt;/a&gt; of the new Macs all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-issues-i-worked-around-or-fixed:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Some issues I worked around or fixed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-failing-touchpad-driver-update:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The failing touchpad driver update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 tried to install an update for the touchpad driver and kept on failing. This was &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19643591&#34;&gt;a known issue&lt;/a&gt; you could safely ignore. Microsoft offers a utility to hide some specific updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-dell-adapter:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The Dell adapter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing and plugging in the Dell adapter I bought, gave me BSoDs and a lot of other crap. Installing a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/downloads.php&#34; title=&#34;DisplayLink drivers&#34;&gt;recent driver from DisplayLink&lt;/a&gt;, its manufacturer, fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;distorted-sound:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Distorted sound&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the audio driver went berserk and the sound became very distorted. Disabling and enabling the Realtek HW audio codec usually fixed it temporarily, but it was finally fixed after installing a new version of the Realtek audio driver last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;update:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue reappeared a few hours after publishing this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;missing-settings-in-the-power-management-section-of-the-control-panel:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Missing settings in the power management section of the control panel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell offers a great utility called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/7535.dell-command-power-manager&#34;&gt;Dell Command | Power&lt;/a&gt; which you should definitely install if you own a recent Dell laptop. You can optimize various settings that avoid battery wear (e.g. optimize the charging algorithm for a laptop that is often plugged into the charger or keep the laptop extra cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/54127-power-options-add-remove-wireless-adapter-settings.html&#34;&gt;this trick&lt;/a&gt; to enable some settings in the control panel that were hidden by the manufacturer of your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;slow-wi-fi:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Slow Wi-Fi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the Wi-Fi driver that&amp;rsquo;s available on Intel&amp;rsquo;s website fixed an issue where I would experience a very slow Wi-Fi connection from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-issues-i-still-experience:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Some issues I still experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep-hibernate-coma:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Sleep, hibernate, COMA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, when I close the lid of my XPS 13, the laptop immediately goes to sleep. When I open it up again, everything is back up and running in less than a second. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I connect an external monitor to the laptop (be it through the Dell adapter I bought or be it with a DisplayPort-VGA adapter), things start getting crazy. If I take a break of half an hour or more, I can&amp;rsquo;t get the laptop to wake up again. I tried everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pressing a random key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moving or tapping on the touchpad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pressing the power button (the power LED is turned off, by the way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disconnecting every external device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plugging the charger in/out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only action that gets my laptop out of its coma is holding the power button down for a few seconds, then it starts booting up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;crazy-multi-monitor-dpi-issues:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Crazy multi-monitor DPI issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see Windows from a new perspective, connect an external monitor with a different DPI scaling than the one on your laptop screen. All sorts of crazy things start to happen. I suspect the issue above is related to this one. Windows rarely gets it right on the first try. Sometimes it uses the higher DPI scaling on both monitors. It never picks the default DPI scaling (100%) for both monitors. A reboot usually fixes most of my issues, but they often reappear when I resume the machine from sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am seriously considering buying an extra monitor just so I could use the same DPI scaling on both screens&amp;hellip; Rebooting Windows doesn&amp;rsquo;t take more than 10 seconds, but you still have to close all your programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-review:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;A quick review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-battery-life:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The battery life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell promises 10+ hours of battery life with this laptop. I never even got close. You&amp;rsquo;d probably only get this with your laptop on the lowest brightness setting in flight mode. I usually get up to 8 hours with light usage (browsing, reading&amp;hellip;) and up to 4 hours with heavy usage (running multiple instances of Visual Studio and building about every 15 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the battery life, it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as expected, but still a lot better than what you get from most other (non-Apple) laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-screen:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The screen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software developers need to start thinking about high DPI screens. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get the 4K screen. I love the thin bezels and the screen looks very good except in direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-touchpad:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The touchpad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend playing a little bit with the settings. A lot of people seem to be complaining about some kind of lag or delay. You can adjust this delay in the settings. I&amp;rsquo;ve put it on the shortest delay, but haven&amp;rsquo;t disabled the delay completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The touchpad works fine; it registers everything I want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-keyboard:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;The keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keys are very thin but typing is very comfortable. The backspace and the FN buttons are placed awkwardly (especially if you use multiple desktops in Windows 10), but I got used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance really depends on the configuration you pick. I picked the Intel i7-5600U with 8 GB of RAM. I would have loved a 16 GB configuration and all you can upgrade is the SSD. It isn&amp;rsquo;t as fast as the quad core i7 with Hyper Threading I used to have, but the difference is hardly noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:b79f60f580df3e0f9ebbeafe51282028&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with my XPS 13. The battery is great, it almost never gets hot and it&amp;rsquo;s very small and lightweight being a 13-inch laptop. Microsoft, Dell and their partners seem to be working hard on fixing driver issues and making Windows 10 a very pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPI issues I mentioned would probably also happen on other high DPI laptops. I have never used this laptop with Windows 8.1, which has a different DPI scaling system. There&amp;rsquo;s a utility available online which reverts your DPI scaling system to the one in Windows 8, but it made the situation even worse when I connected an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hardening your WordPress security</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/hardening-your-wordpress-security/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of a guide about &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/recovering-a-hacked-wordpress/&#34;&gt;recovering a hacked WordPress&lt;/a&gt; and hardening your WordPress security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous part, I showed you how to get back up and running after your website has been hacked. In this part I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how you can avoid being hacked by making your WordPress more secure. I always try to be exhaustive, but if you have any suggestions, corrections or feel like anything is missing, I would like you to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:s@muel.be?subject=Suggestions%20for%20the%20post%20about%20securing%20Wordpress&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not hacked, I still advice you to read the first part too. It contains some information about how attackers work, what they try to achieve and how you can make sure they lose access to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;I planned on writing this guide a lot earlier and it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at my WordPress websites (which is not a good practice&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ll update this guide in about a month.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this guide focusses on security, some measures could impact the performance of your website negatively while others should impact your performance positively. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to consider which measures tips you should implement and which you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s get started, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;consider-to-use-a-cloud-proxy:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Consider to use a cloud proxy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a good CDN and caching strategy, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to survive a DDoS attack. The easiest solution is a reverse cloud proxy like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;. CloudFlare caches your content and allows for very precise configuration. They will also keep your static files online if your server went offline. CloudFlare offers very good protection against malicious visitors and is awesome at detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/&#34;&gt;a WordPress plugin&lt;/a&gt; that helps with the reverse proxying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;encryption:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudFlare, the tool I mentioned above, offers free server-client SSL. It isn&amp;rsquo;t as secure as full SSL (SSL from your server to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s servers and from CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s servers to your visitor&amp;rsquo;s browsers), but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot safer than plain HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-sure-the-web-servers-are-secure:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Make sure the web servers are secure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on shared hosting, you don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this, but you can still take measures to ensure your management portal access is safe. Use very strong passwords to manage your web server, make sure everything (PHP, MySQL, Apache&amp;hellip;) is up to date, only allow database access from your web server (usually localhost)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perspective to look at this is securing access to your files. Store your backups in a safe location, make sure that the WordPress folders and files have the right permissions (this changes sometimes, take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions&#34;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; to find out which permissions you should use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-strong-authentication-and-authorisation:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Use strong authentication and authorisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use strong passwords, make sure your wp-config.php is only stored on the webserver itself, consider using &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-2-step-verification/&#34;&gt;MFA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; There are a lot of ways to make sure that it isn&amp;rsquo;t too easy to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;consider-using-a-3rd-party-email-provider:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Consider using a 3rd party email provider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most hackers don&amp;rsquo;t even want to hack your website itself. Usually they&amp;rsquo;ll want to use your mail server (which is usually running on the same server) and domain to sell them to spammers. A third party email service like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mandrillapp.com/&#34;&gt;Mandrill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://sendgrid.com/&#34;&gt;SendGrid&lt;/a&gt; could come in handy to avoid such attacks. I recommend disabling the local mail server and creating SPF and DKIM records that only emails from your email provider. It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to setup Mandrill with WordPress with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmandrill/&#34;&gt;this Mandrill plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;always-use-the-latest-versions:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Always use the latest versions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/&#34;&gt;PHP is a terrible programming language.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to write a lot of bugs and never notice them. If a plugin or theme is updated, install the update. Every possible fix for security issues is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstall-plugins-and-themes-you-don-t-need:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Uninstall plugins and themes you don&amp;rsquo;t need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need a plugin or theme, uninstall it completely. Don&amp;rsquo;t even leave it deactivated. Hackers can run code in deactivated plugins without any hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;schedule-security-scans:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Schedule security scans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/exploit-scanner/&#34;&gt;Exploit Scanner&lt;/a&gt; is perfectly capable of scanning a WordPress installation for (possible) exploits, you can&amp;rsquo;t use it to schedule automatic scans. &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/&#34;&gt;Sucuri Security&lt;/a&gt; is definitely a must-have for every WordPress website. You can schedule automatic scans for modified files, notifications for about everything that happens on your website, thorough measures to further harden your website&amp;rsquo;s security&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;log-bad-behaviour:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Log bad behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an awesome plugin called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/bad-behavior/&#34;&gt;Bad Behavior&lt;/a&gt; which logs malicious looking behaviour and notifies you if you want to. If you suspect a hacker is trying to get in, install this plugin. You can then use to automatically block some of his attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice some brute force attacks on your &lt;em&gt;wp-login.php&lt;/em&gt; page, consider installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/&#34;&gt;Limit Login Attempts&lt;/a&gt;. You can fine-tune its settings so that it&amp;rsquo;s not too hard on your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;change-the-defaults:270325a472963f8dbe8695a68f29ae37&#34;&gt;Change the defaults&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress allows you to change a lot of the default settings, here are a few things you could change to improve security by obscurity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store the &lt;em&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/em&gt; file a level higher than the root of your WordPress installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Moving_wp-content_folder&#34;&gt;Move the &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; folder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use the &lt;code&gt;wp_&lt;/code&gt; table prefix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a different &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/sf-move-login/&#34;&gt;login url&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the user that was created during the initial setup and create a new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use the username &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Wercker step to minify static resources</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/wercker-step-to-minify-static-resources/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2015 17:01:17 +0200</pubDate>
      <author>s@muel.be (Samuel Debruyn)</author>
      <guid>http://sa.muel.be/2015/wercker-step-to-minify-static-resources/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently blogged a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/an-introduction-to-hugo-a-static-site-generator/&#34;&gt;static websites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/continuous-integration-with-hugo-and-wercker/&#34;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;. There was still one step missing in my continuous integration cycle: &lt;strong&gt;minification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wercker.com/&#34;&gt;Wercker&lt;/a&gt; is a great CI tool and it allows you to create custom build steps that can be reused in several projects. So I created a build step to minify HTML, CSS and JS files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build step is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/wercker-step-minify&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/wercker-step-minify&lt;/a&gt; and all you have to do is include &lt;code&gt;samueldebruyn/minify&lt;/code&gt; as a step in your &lt;em&gt;wercker.yml&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wercker step to validate Hugo themes</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/wercker-step-to-validate-hugo-themes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 13:21:45 +0200</pubDate>
      <author>s@muel.be (Samuel Debruyn)</author>
      <guid>http://sa.muel.be/2015/wercker-step-to-validate-hugo-themes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week, I created &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/material-lite-theme-for-hugo/&#34;&gt;a material design theme&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator which I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/tags/hugo/&#34;&gt;quite fond of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/continuous-integration-with-hugo-and-wercker/&#34;&gt;discovered Wercker&lt;/a&gt;, an awesome CI tool, I went looking for a way to automatically validate themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any, so I simply wrote a build step for &lt;a href=&#34;http://wercker.com&#34;&gt;Wercker&lt;/a&gt;. The build step validates a Hugo theme using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/HugoBasicExample&#34;&gt;an example site&lt;/a&gt;. It also checks if you included some files required for a future Hugo themes site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for the build step is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/wercker-step-hugo-theme-check&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/wercker-step-hugo-theme-check&lt;/a&gt; and an example &lt;em&gt;wercker.yml&lt;/em&gt; configuration is included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;box: debian
build:
  steps:
    - samueldebruyn/hugo-theme-check:
        version: &amp;quot;0.14&amp;quot;
        theme: material-lite
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s the easiest way to create a simple website about a repository and you can even use &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to start blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I recently switched from Jekyll to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, I needed a new way to enable continuous integration for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-to-ci:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;New to CI?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration, or CI, means that your code is automatically built, tested and/or deployed after each push. Every time you push some commits to a remote repository, the code in that repository is being built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually have a branch called &lt;em&gt;develop&lt;/em&gt; to which I push fresh code. Then a CI tool checks if that code builds properly and if it does, I merge it to my &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&#34;&gt;Git Flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-hugo-and-github-pages:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;What about Hugo and GitHub Pages?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could setup a CI tool to build your code after every push on every branch and deploy it to GitHub Pages after a successful build on your stable/&lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-comes-wercker:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;In comes Wercker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://travis-ci.org&#34;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; for all my CI needs, but then I came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://wercker.com&#34;&gt;Wercker&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/&#34;&gt;Hugo docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wercker simplifies CI a lot and relies on &lt;a href=&#34;http://docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; for its build environments. It also allows you to deploy your builds to different environments (e.g. production, staging, testing&amp;hellip;) Hugo has a guide about how to set it up, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit outdated. I might just send a pull request with an update in a few days. Wercker also has a lot of documentation. So with the examples below, you should be able to easily walk through the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-it-up:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;Setting it up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Wercker app based on the repository containing your Hugo source code and give Wercker access rights. You can leave everything else on the default settings. If you&amp;rsquo;d like a badge showing your build status, make sure your app is public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, edit your app settings and create a custom deploy target including a protected environment variable called &lt;code&gt;GIT_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, add a file called &lt;em&gt;wercker.yml&lt;/em&gt; to your repository with the code below. Change it to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;box: debian
build:
  steps:
    - script:
        name: install git
        code: |
          apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get install git -y
    - script:
        name: initialize git submodules
        code: |
            git submodule update --init --recursive
    - arjen/hugo-build:
        version: &amp;quot;0.14&amp;quot;
        theme: crisp
deploy:
  steps:
    - script:
        name: install git
        code: |
          apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get install git -y
    - leipert/git-push:
        gh_oauth: $GIT_TOKEN
        basedir: public
        clean_removed_files: true
        branch: master
        repo: SamuelDebruyn/samueldebruyn.github.io
        gh_pages_domain: sa.muel.be
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you have to change the following variables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;: the Hugo version you use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;theme&lt;/code&gt;: the theme you use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;branch&lt;/code&gt;: the branch on GitHub Pages you wish to publish on (should be &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; for personal/organization pages and &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; for project pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;repo&lt;/code&gt;: the repository you wish to publish your pages in (should be &lt;code&gt;username/username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; for personal/organization pages and &lt;code&gt;username/project-repo&lt;/code&gt; for project pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gh_pages_domain&lt;/code&gt;: a custom CNAME (optional, &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&#34;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push a commit with that file and Wercker should happily start building and deploying your code!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-few-examples:bd381cc8b449e1516244ba8b37d0246b&#34;&gt;A few examples&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Material-lite theme for Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/an-introduction-to-hugo-a-static-site-generator/&#34;&gt;I wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; about how awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is and why I switched from Jekyll to Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few days later, Google released an awesome template called &lt;a href=&#34;http://getmdl.io&#34;&gt;Material Design Lite&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s basically Google&amp;rsquo;s famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html&#34;&gt;Material Design&lt;/a&gt; in HTML, CSS and JavaScript instead of in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polymer-project.org&#34;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about setting up another website for some side project and wanted to use material design. So I decided to write a material design theme for a simple Hugo blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/hugo-material-lite&#34;&gt;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/hugo-material-lite&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://materialexample.sa.muel.be&#34;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;) Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An introduction to Hugo, a static site generator</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/an-introduction-to-hugo-a-static-site-generator/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-good-blogging-platform:a34406b09f2f50ebfd1f011b1ed64076&#34;&gt;A good blogging platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a good blogging platform really good? Well, that depends on the blogger. Programmers would need different features than make-up bloggers. As a programmer, I need to be able to easily integrate pieces of code with syntax highlighting in my posts and I&amp;rsquo;d prefer writing them in my favourite text/code editor instead of in a WYSIWYG editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jekyll:a34406b09f2f50ebfd1f011b1ed64076&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static site generator like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; fulfils (almost) all my needs as a programmer/blogger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posts are written in &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, Textile, HTML&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t need to setup a database and any simple web server will do the job since all you have to host is a simple, static website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;once setup, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to think about updates etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extremely developer friendly (e.g. publish a post using the command line) and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works great with source code control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a while, you start to notice the little things that make Jekyll a lot less simple than it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s written in Ruby and some of its dependencies aren&amp;rsquo;t (bug free) available on &lt;del&gt;all platforms&lt;/del&gt; Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting it up can be quite bothersome, again, especially on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo:a34406b09f2f50ebfd1f011b1ed64076&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other static site generators &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com&#34;&gt;have sprung up&lt;/a&gt; since Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one that caught my attention was &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. It has all the goodness from Jekyll, but it&amp;rsquo;s way easier to setup. Hugo itself is written in &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;, but they build &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases&#34;&gt;executable binaries&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of platforms and architectures. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install anything else. Even compiling it yourself isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of creating a new website is very similar to Jekyll. The &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command literally explains itself (&lt;code&gt;hugo help&lt;/code&gt;) and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on its website should suffice for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully migrated my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/samueldebruyn.github.io/tree/5f5719a9d4519f8fbd4cdfffa2a10b3f066401ef&#34;&gt;Jekyll blog&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/sa.muel.be-hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and haven&amp;rsquo;t regretted it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disadvantages:a34406b09f2f50ebfd1f011b1ed64076&#34;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major disadvantages of Hugo, or any static site generator for that matter, is integrating &lt;strong&gt;search&lt;/strong&gt;. You need some &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/how-are-you-implementing-site-search/986/14&#34;&gt;JavaScript magic&lt;/a&gt; or a 3rd party search provider like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cse.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Custom Search Engine&lt;/a&gt; (which I went for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other dynamic part of an ordinary blog is &lt;strong&gt;the comment section&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, the easiest way to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; this is relying on a 3rd party comments plugin like &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, these two disadvantages are easily outweighed by the advantages of a static website. Your website will survive &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect&#34;&gt;slashdotting&lt;/a&gt; and the only required maintenance is literally making sure your web server stays online.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recovering a hacked WordPress</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/recovering-a-hacked-wordpress/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I had to &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/about-that-time-i-dealt-with-a-bunch-of-hackers-on-a-wordpress/&#34;&gt;repair a hacked WordPress&lt;/a&gt; installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the information I needed to successfully clean the WordPress completely of infected files was not centralized in a single guide. So I decided to write one and you are now reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, your website is hacked, what now? Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the process of making sure that every infection is removed and it never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first part you&amp;rsquo;ll recover from a hack. In a second part you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to harden the security. I&amp;rsquo;ll publish &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/hardening-your-wordpress-security/&#34;&gt;the second part&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks after the first part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to be exhaustive and clear. If you have any suggestions or feel like something is missing or unclear, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:s@muel.be?subject=Suggestions%20for%20the%20post%20about%20recovering%20a%20Wordpress%20hack&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WordPress version I used to write this post is 4.2.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disabling-all-plugins-going-into-maintenance-mode:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Disabling all plugins / going into maintenance mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is avoiding further infections. &lt;strong&gt;Disable EVERY plugin&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll reactivate them later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also put the website in maintenance mode. This requires, ironically, a plugin called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-maintenance-mode/&#34;&gt;WP Maintenance Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Install it, write a quick message for your visitors and enable it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-a-backup:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Take a backup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup your complete WordPress folder and database. You can download all the files using FTP or SSH and export the database to SQL statements using something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php&#34;&gt;phpMyAdmin&lt;/a&gt; or the customer panel of your host (CPanel, DirectAdmin&amp;hellip;). Don&amp;rsquo;t store the backup on your webserver as the hackers could also infect this backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;restore-the-original-wordpress-files:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Restore the original WordPress files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/&#34;&gt;a fresh copy of the version of WordPress&lt;/a&gt; you were using (which should always be the latest one). Unpack it and replace the directories &lt;em&gt;wp-admin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wp-includes&lt;/em&gt; completely with the copy you just downloaded. Do the same with every file in the root folder and remove every file in your root that is not in the downloaded copy except for &lt;em&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;only folder left untouched should be &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. WordPress also doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the &lt;em&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/em&gt; file so that should also be preserved (we&amp;rsquo;ll inspect this file later on in this guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;clearing-the-cache:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Clearing the cache&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delete the folders &lt;em&gt;wp-content/cache&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wp-content/plugins/widgets&lt;/em&gt;. They will be automatically recreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;regenerate-salts-and-hashes:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Regenerate salts and hashes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/em&gt; file contains a few hashes and salts to make sure that your cookies and sessions are unique and secure. As these could have been compromised, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/strong&gt; to regenerate them. Open your &lt;em&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/em&gt; file in a text editor and overwrite your new hashes with new ones. WordPress offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/&#34;&gt;an online generator&lt;/a&gt; so you can easily copy and paste them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgrade-to-the-latest-version:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Upgrade to the latest version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not on the latest version of WordPress, then update ASAP. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress_-_Extended_Instructions&#34;&gt;these extended instructions&lt;/a&gt; instead of the built-in updater, but the built-in updater should be fine for most infected websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade all your themes and plugins&lt;/strong&gt; while you&amp;rsquo;re at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;restore-the-original-themes-and-plugins:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Restore the original themes and plugins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step we&amp;rsquo;re going to restore the original theme and plugin files like we did with the original WordPress files. Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/themes/&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&#34;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; from wordpress.org or from the website of the publisher of the plugin or theme (for premium/payed versions). All you need to do is unpack the files into their respective directories in &lt;em&gt;wp-content/themes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wp-content/plugins&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure there are no other files than the ones you just replaced in both of these folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: some plugins (e.g. plugins containing &lt;a href=&#34;http://wpengineer.com/2500/wordpress-dropins/&#34;&gt;drop-ins&lt;/a&gt;) like &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/&#34;&gt;WP Super Cache&lt;/a&gt; also put PHP files in your &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-and-delete-infections-in-your-files:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Search and delete infections in your files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only infected files left could be stored in the subfolders of &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; that we haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;languages:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;languages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your WordPress is in English, you can safely delete the contents of the &lt;em&gt;languages&lt;/em&gt; folder, otherwise you should download the translation in your language and put in the &lt;em&gt;wp-content/languages&lt;/em&gt; while deleting everything else in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;upgrade:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;upgrade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folder &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; is used by WordPress&amp;rsquo; built-in updater and should always be empty except for when you&amp;rsquo;re updating of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;uploads-and-other-folders:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;uploads and other folders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up: search every other folder in &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; for PHP and server configuration files and delete files if you think they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there. I suggest doing a case insensitive search for &lt;em&gt;*.php&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; and carefully inspecting the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;find /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ -iname &amp;quot;*.php&amp;quot; -or -iname &amp;quot;.htaccess&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any PHP or .htaccess files in &lt;em&gt;wp-content/uploads/someyear/&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally search all the remaining files for typical code injections. PHP injections usually contain the functions &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;base64_decode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;egrep &#39;eval(|decode(&#39; -r -H /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;search-and-delete-infections-in-your-database:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Search and delete infections in your database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most infections are usually to be found in the files, hackers could also insert executable and obfuscated code into your database. Most often these are XSS injections and WordPress should protect you against them. Still, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to scan your posts and comments for injected code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to connect to your database right away using something like the previously mentioned &lt;em&gt;phpMyAdmin&lt;/em&gt; tool. Login, open the database and go to the SQL page so you can run some SQL commands. The select statements below will show you the posts and comments containing common injections. Use a &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; query (be careful) or the &lt;em&gt;phpMyAdmin&lt;/em&gt; GUI to completely delete the found posts and comments. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to change &lt;code&gt;wp_&lt;/code&gt; to the prefix you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;iframe%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;noscript%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE &#39;%display:%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;?%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;?php%&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;iframe%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;noscript%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_content LIKE &#39;%display:%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;?%&#39;
UNION
SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_content LIKE &#39;%&amp;lt;?php%&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-exploit-scanner-and-sucuri-security-to-detect-further-infections:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Exploit Scanner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sucuri Security&lt;/em&gt; to detect further infections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most code injections should be gone by now, but there are a few WordPress plugins available to detect everything that&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/exploit-scanner/&#34;&gt;Exploit Scanner&lt;/a&gt; scans your files for possible hidden infections. Its options allow you to also scan for iframes etc., but they cause a lot of false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/&#34;&gt;Sucuri Security&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin I&amp;rsquo;d really recommend for any WordPress installation, whether you were hacked or not. The plugin allows you to automatically scan for changed files, notify you about any administrative action, easily reinstall every plugin and theme after a hack&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of all possibilities of the free versions of both of them. They will make sure that your WordPress is clean and stays clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;check-users-and-passwords:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Check users and passwords&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the last steps is to check if the hacker didn&amp;rsquo;t create any new users. While you&amp;rsquo;re at it, change the passwords of every user with more rights than a regular subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;restoring-your-website-and-keeping-it-safe:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Restoring your website and keeping it safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your WordPress should now be clean of infections and you can start restoring your website. Turn maintenance mode off and deactivate the &lt;em&gt;WP Maintenance Mode&lt;/em&gt; plugin. Now activate all the other plugins you used one by one. Make sure to &lt;strong&gt;delete any plugin you don&amp;rsquo;t really need&lt;/strong&gt; and check if they are still being maintained/updated. I&amp;rsquo;d also delete every inactive theme. This part of the guide is crucial since it was probably one of the plugins that was used to accomplish the hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;harden-your-wordpress-security:b271d4e596dc01ff609a631b1dcbeb8c&#34;&gt;Harden your WordPress Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll publish &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/2015/hardening-your-wordpress-security/&#34;&gt;a follow-up guide&lt;/a&gt; on improving the security on your WordPress website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://sa.muel.be/2015/about-that-time-i-dealt-with-a-bunch-of-hackers-on-a-wordpress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that happened. I recently took over 2 WordPress installations hosted on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.versio.uk/&#34;&gt;Versio&lt;/a&gt; shared hosting account. Versio suspended the account because it kept sending thousands of (spam) emails a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guessed it right, one of the WordPress installations was hacked. The previous administrator tried to delete the infected files and changed his passwords. It took them a week to regain full control of both the WordPress installations. Once they got into one of the WordPress setups, it was just a matter of navigating through the filesystem to find and infect the other WordPress installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intruders were very interested in this particular website because of the domain (TLD): &lt;a href=&#34;http://asr.ac&#34;&gt;asr.ac&lt;/a&gt;. An academic domain has a high standing, isn&amp;rsquo;t very cheap and a very rare treat for spammers. They were proud of their hack and left code injections in files called &lt;em&gt;indonesia.php&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I took over. I managed tens of WordPress websites before and I had a lot more time to spare than the previous IT guy. I found out that the contact address for Versio and a bunch of other services was one of the .ac addresses, which was suspended. So we didn&amp;rsquo;t even receive any warnings from Versio about abuse, the hackers had free play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I regained access to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.directadmin.com/&#34;&gt;DirectAdmin&lt;/a&gt; and Versio&amp;rsquo;s customer panel, I immediately backed up both installations, including the databases. Exporting the content and importing it into a fresh WordPress installation was a no go since the &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; directory was infected. The only option seemed to desinfect both WordPress installation and secure them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Versio sent some notices with the files the hackers used to send out spam. They were all PHP files with obfuscated code injections in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, so I knew how they did it and what I had to look for. I simply deleted everything except for the &lt;em&gt;wp-content&lt;/em&gt; directory and searched the &lt;em&gt;uploads&lt;/em&gt; folder for code containing &lt;em&gt;eval(&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;decode(&lt;/em&gt;. I then uploaded the default WordPress files and made sure everything worked again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme we used was an outdated premium theme so I replaced that with a more popular similar looking theme which was kept up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; with secure settings and let them challenge visitors from Indonesia. I also installed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/&#34;&gt;Sucuri Security plugin&lt;/a&gt; and let it scan all files twice a day for infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was all, right? Nope, a few days later they were back. This time they named their files something like &lt;em&gt;diff52.php&lt;/em&gt; as this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look as suspicious as &lt;em&gt;indonesia.php&lt;/em&gt;. CloudFlare also showed some blocked threats from Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/addendum/2015/obfuscated-code-from-the-wordpress-hack/&#34;&gt;This is an example of the code I found&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sa.muel.be/addendum/2015/deobfuscated-code-from-the-wordpress-hack/&#34;&gt;this is the deobfuscated version of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeated the whole process but I kept wondering how they could get in. The only thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t check were the plugins. A few days before I reinstalled them all using Sucuri Security so they didn&amp;rsquo;t contain any infections. But they had to be the cause, right? I simply deactivated and removed all of them except for the ones I installed to secure the website. That did it. It&amp;rsquo;s been a week and the hackers haven&amp;rsquo;t been back since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I learn from all of this? When you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a hacked WordPress, &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; delete every plugin and non-default theme. The team behind WordPress releases security updates in a few hours after they find a leak. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ma.ttias.be/in-defence-of-wordpress/&#34;&gt;WordPress is quite secure&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s the plugins and the themes that aren&amp;rsquo;t. Themes and plugins used by a lot of people will probably get more security fixes than others. The more plugins or themes you have installed, the bigger the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I repeated every step on the second WordPress installation since that one was infected too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPS: I&amp;rsquo;ll post a comprehensive guide to securing/hardening WordPress in a few weeks. A good starting point is &lt;a href=&#34;https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geocoding addresses in Talend Open Studio for Data Integration</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/geocoding-addresses-in-talend-open-studio-for-data-integration/</link>

      <guid>http://sa.muel.be/2015/geocoding-addresses-in-talend-open-studio-for-data-integration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had to geocode the addresses in a dataset using Talend. Geocoding is adding coordinates to addresses. This way you can easily visualize your data on a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced problems when I tried to download some plugins from Talend Exchange but I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://datacatalyst.blogspot.be/2011/01/custom-google-geocoder-using-talend.html&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; about geocoding without the use of a plugin. The blogpost wasn&amp;rsquo;t very clear so I decided to write a step-by-step explanation which you can find below. In this guide, we will be using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/&#34;&gt;Google Geocoding API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map your location dataset (with a &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt;) to 2 columns: an unique ID of your location and a concatenated string containing the location address. I used one of Talend&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;em&gt;StringHandling&lt;/em&gt;-functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  StringHandling.CHANGE(LOCATIONS.STREET_ADDRESS + LOCATIONS.POSTAL_CODE + LOCATIONS.CITY,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first column was called &lt;em&gt;LOCATION_ID&lt;/em&gt; and my second column was called &lt;em&gt;LOCATION_CONCAT_ADDRESS&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure to remember the name of your output. I named mine &lt;em&gt;LocConcatOut&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, connect your output from the &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;tFlowToIterate&lt;/em&gt; component to start processing all records one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output from the &lt;em&gt;tFlowToIterate&lt;/em&gt; has to be connected to a new &lt;em&gt;tFileInputJson&lt;/em&gt; component. You can change the number of parallel iterations to speed up the geocoding. In the &lt;em&gt;tFileInputJson&lt;/em&gt; component, check the &lt;em&gt;Use Url&lt;/em&gt; option and enter the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address= + ((String)globalMap.get(&amp;quot;LocConcatOut.LOCATION_CONCAT_ADDRESS&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;+ &amp;quot;&amp;amp;key=YourAPIkey&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; if you would like to use your own API key for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/&#34;&gt;Google Geocoding API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit the schema for this component and make sure it contains 2 columns: &lt;em&gt;LATITUDE&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LONGITUDE&lt;/em&gt;. Their type should be float, nullable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mapping, &lt;em&gt;LATITUDE&lt;/em&gt; should be set to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;$.results[0].geometry.location.lat&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LONGITUDE&lt;/em&gt; should be set to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;$.results[0].geometry.location.lng&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to map the coordinates back to the UIDs. Add another &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt; component at the end. Create a new output, map the 2 coordinates from the &lt;em&gt;tFileInputJson&lt;/em&gt; to identical columns in the new &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt; and create a new column with a primary key. Enter the following for the value of this key (my keys are integers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ((Integer)globalMap.get(&amp;quot;LocConcatOut.LOCATION_ID&amp;quot;)).intValue()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally connect the output from the &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt; component to a &lt;em&gt;tBufferOutput&lt;/em&gt;. That ends the loop started with the &lt;em&gt;tFlowToIterate&lt;/em&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previously mentioned components should all be put in the same subjob. Use a trigger like &lt;em&gt;OnSubjobOk&lt;/em&gt; to start your next job after this one is completed. You can find all the location identifiers with their coordinates in the &lt;em&gt;tBufferInput&lt;/em&gt; component. This is easily mapped (joined) to the original locations dataset using a &lt;em&gt;tMap&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure to set the correct data types in the mapping (1 integer and 2 floats) for the &lt;em&gt;tBufferInput&lt;/em&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope my guide is clear, but you can always &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@SamuelDebruyn%20&#34;&gt;tweet me&lt;/a&gt; with any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Google cripples outdated Android devices</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-downgraded-my-nexus-5:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;Why I downgraded my Nexus 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago Google released &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html&#34;&gt;Android L Developer Preview&lt;/a&gt;. This preview of the upcoming Android Lollipop (5.0) release contained a lot of bugs and was definitely not &lt;em&gt;daily driver&lt;/em&gt; material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Google started updating Nexus devices to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://officialandroid.blogspot.be/2014/10/android-be-together-not-same.html&#34;&gt;final version of Android Lollipop&lt;/a&gt; last autumn, it was clear that not all bugs were gone. Users noticed several bugs of which the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79729&#34;&gt;memory leak on the Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt; was the worst. Power users had to reboot their device every 2 days and other users could go half a week without rebooting. Without a reboot, apps closed automatically a few seconds after opening and background services like Spotify shut down the moment you opened a memory intensive app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/12/15/nexus-5-receive-android-5-0-1-today-according-sprint-t-mobile/&#34;&gt;Android 5.0.1 update&lt;/a&gt; came and went while fixing a few bugs, but the memory leak was still there. Apparently it had something to do with the fade out animation when you turned off your screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few weeks back, Google released Android 5.1. It contained some UI and functional improvements and the memory leak was gone, at last! But don’t start cheering too soon. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/15/google-android-5-1-memory-leak-has-been-fixed-internally-no-timeline-for-release-yet/&#34;&gt;Android 5.1 contained another memory leak&lt;/a&gt;. The Android developers already fixed it, but at the time of writing, they still don’t have a timeframe for a release of this fix. The rebooting went on, every other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you have a car accident and you need to call emergency services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, wait, I have to reboot my phone first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drives me nuts. This seems a critical bug to me. A (smart)phone mustto be able to perform its most basic function all the time: calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered downgrading while I was on Android 5.0.1, but I quickly delayed this decision when I heard about the upcoming 5.1 update that would fix this memory leak. However, when I started noticing the second memory leak, I had it. Time to go back to the latest stable version: Android 4.4.4 KitKat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-downgraded:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;How I downgraded&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downgrade was quite simple: I unlocked my phone and flashed the 4.4.4 &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images&#34;&gt;factory image&lt;/a&gt;. The next thing I did was rooting my phone, which later turned out to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then-it-all-started:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;And then it all started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I downgraded, was that Android 4.4.4 has remarkably better battery life than Android Lollipop. So when my battery started draining at more than 20% an hour, I knew that something was wrong. Also, the notification about the system update was impossible to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Google, I know. Now let me go on with my life, I don’t want your update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;digging-a-little-deeper:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;Digging a little deeper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android used to have a service called SystemUpdateService in the Google Services Framework (preinstalled system app) that would handle OS updates. It seems like this was replaced by Google Play Services. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html&#34;&gt;Google Play Services&lt;/a&gt; app is updated automatically via the Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&#34;&gt;Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. This app contains another SystemUpdateService and disables the SystemUpdateService in the Google Services Framework mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service seems to cause a &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html&#34;&gt;wakelock&lt;/a&gt;, which makes sure that my Nexus 5 never goes to deep sleep. (Deep sleep is like a standby mode with very low power usage.) So there’s my battery drain. But how to stop it? Disabling this service doesn’t help at all. The notification disappears but the wakelock is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step: Google and &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/general/how-to-disable-ota-lollipop-wakelock-t2952845&#34;&gt;XDA&lt;/a&gt;. I found out about the 3 receivers that trigger this service. Disabling these receivers would make sure that SystemUpdateService never runs and the wakelock is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The receivers are to be found in 3 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After startup (runs after booting your device, obviously)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connectivity changed (runs when the status of your Wi-Fi or cellular data connections change)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secret code entered (runs when you enter a secret code into the dialer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it’s quite impossible to escape from this service. The commands I listed below correctly disable these receivers and related activities. It doesn’t disable the SystemUpdateService itself as this would cause wakelocks. Run them in a terminal on your device or on your PC connected with your phone over &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html&#34;&gt;ADB&lt;/a&gt;. Did I mention you need to be &lt;em&gt;rooted&lt;/em&gt; to run it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gms/.update.SystemUpdateActivity
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gms/.update.SystemUpdateService$ActiveReceiver
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gms/.update.SystemUpdateService$Receiver
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gms/.update.SystemUpdateService$SecretCodeReceiver
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gsf/.update.SystemUpdateActivity
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gsf/.update.SystemUpdatePanoActivity
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gsf/.update.SystemUpdateService$Receiver
adb shell su -c pm disable com.google.android.gsf/.update.SystemUpdateService$SecretCodeReceiver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wow-that-was-complicated:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;Wow, that was complicated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For power users this probably wasn’t a lot of work, but this is a real annoyance for regular users. But regular users don’t buy Nexus devices, don’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, we all &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=android%20fragmentation&amp;amp;cmpt=q&#34;&gt;complained about fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of OS updates. Today it has become impossible to ignore an OS update due to the immense battery drain and the frustrating persistent notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-post-is-all-about-nexus-devices-what-about-my-device:c209b0e2d2354aad9e56c75e001a618a&#34;&gt;This post is all about Nexus devices, what about my device?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Android devices come with Google services like the Google Play Store. This means they also come with Google Play Services or the Google Services Framework or both. So, if you ever want to downgrade your Android device to a stock image, be sure to disable those pesky receivers…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Natively boot Windows 10 Technical Preview with a virtual HDD</title>
      <link>http://sa.muel.be/2015/natively-boot-windows-10-technical-preview-with-a-virtual-hdd/</link>

      <author>s@muel.be (Samuel Debruyn)</author>
      <guid>http://sa.muel.be/2015/natively-boot-windows-10-technical-preview-with-a-virtual-hdd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://insider.windows.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft released a new build for Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; and I wanted to give it a try. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to resize my partitions or overwrite my Windows 8.1 partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then install it in a VM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to all of my RAM and CPU, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a solution either. However, I found the ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently you can &lt;strong&gt;install Windows in a virtual hard drive&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me guide you through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new VHD-file and remember the path to it. You can use &lt;em&gt;Disk Management&lt;/em&gt; (run &lt;code&gt;diskmgmt.msc&lt;/code&gt;) and click &lt;em&gt;Action&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Create VHD&lt;/em&gt;. I made it about 70 GB big with a dynamic size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot into the Windows installation (use &lt;a href=&#34;https://rufus.akeo.ie/&#34;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; or something similar to create a bootable USB stick).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;em&gt;Custom: Install Windows only (Advanced)&lt;/em&gt;, not an &lt;em&gt;Upgrade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have to select the partition on which you want to install Windows. Press &lt;em&gt;SHIFT+F10&lt;/em&gt; to open a command prompt instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;diskpart&lt;/code&gt; to open the DiskPart utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In DiskPart enter &lt;code&gt;select vdisk file=C:\Windows10.vhd&lt;/code&gt; with the correct path to your VHD to select the VHD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now enter &lt;code&gt;attach vdisk&lt;/code&gt; and close the command prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you now press &lt;em&gt;Refresh&lt;/em&gt; you will see unallocated space on a newly added disk station, that is your virtual hard drive. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now continue installing Windows as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find out about this possibility. This way you can try the new Windows &lt;em&gt;in full&lt;/em&gt; without compromising your production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I write Windows Store applications, I use MessageDialog a lot.
It&amp;rsquo;s the easiest way to show a quick informative pop-up message or a question to the user.
However, when you tend to use this quite often, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably run into a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windows Runtime framework doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to stack MessageDialogs, queue them etc.
So if you need to display one, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make sure that no other MessageDialog is already open.
Checking if there is an open MessageDialog is not that easy unless you keep references to all the MessageDialogs you create.
There are a few cases in which this would be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singleton class below will make sure that you can queue MessageDialogs and that this problem will never occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myDialog.ShowAsync()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MessageDialogQueue.PushMessageDialog(myDialog)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dialog will be displayed after all previous MessageDialogs are closed. Do this for all your MessageDialogs or you&amp;rsquo;ll still run into the problem I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
